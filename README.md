# Safe-RL-for-MiniGrid-PPO-with-Hamilton-Jacobi-Safety-Critic

## Implemented safety-constrained reinforcement learning by integrating a PPO algorithm with a safety Q-network using a modified Bellman operator based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis.
## Environment: MiniGrid Lava
## Framework used: SB3 (PPO), PyTorch
## Based on paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794107
